Electronic Device Bans and Academic Performance: New York City Public Schools

Measures the impact of the New York City Department of Education lifting their electronic device ban on school academic performance. In consequence of studying the lifting of the device ban, I estimate the effect of the introduction of unstructured electronic device use on academic performance. A quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis is employed to determine if school state exam passing rates were significantly affected by the lifting of the ban.
